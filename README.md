Wine Quality Prediction
Project Overview
The Wine Quality Prediction project focuses on building a machine learning model to accurately predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. Wine quality is usually determined through sensory analysis by experts, which is subjective and time-consuming. This project aims to automate the process by using data-driven techniques to provide consistent and fast predictions.

Objective
The primary objective was to develop a system that could predict the quality score of a wine sample (on a scale, typically 0–10) using features like acidity, sugar content, pH level, alcohol concentration, and other chemical properties. By doing so, the project supports wineries and distributors in quality control and product development processes.

Dataset
The project utilized the Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of two datasets related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Key features included:

Fixed acidity

Volatile acidity

Citric acid

Residual sugar

Chlorides

Free sulfur dioxide

Total sulfur dioxide

Density

pH

Sulphates

Alcohol

Quality (target variable)

Approach
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, standardized the features, and visualized feature distributions to understand correlations.

Feature Selection: Analyzed feature importance to select the most influential attributes affecting wine quality.

Model Building: Implemented multiple machine learning models including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

Model Evaluation: Used metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R² Score to evaluate model performance. Random Forest achieved the best performance with high accuracy and low error.

Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

Scikit-learn for machine learning

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated that machine learning models can predict wine quality with high reliability. The system provides a scalable solution for the wine industry to automate quality assessments and enhance decision-making processes.
